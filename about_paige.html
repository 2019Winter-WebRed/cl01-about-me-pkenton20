        <!-- This paragraph includes background information about my life. -->
        
        <p>I live in Wilmington with my parents, two sisters, and two dogs. My dog's names are Romo and Kora, and they are German Shepards. I am a junior at Padua Academy. Both of my sisters also go to Padua. Sydney is a senior and Jordan is a freshman. My sisters and I don't look very similar. I went to the Independence School for elementary and middle school. I don't really know what I want to do in college. I am think I would like to major in economics or finance, but I also like chemistry and biology. I don't know where I want to go to college, but I would like it to be near a city. </p>

I started playing travel basketball when I was 10. I play basketball and soccer for Padua now. I used to swim, but I stopped doing that. I learned to swim when I was two.</p>
